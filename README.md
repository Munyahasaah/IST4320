My name is Charles, and I'm currently a student at CSUSB, majoring in Information Systems Technology, Business Intelligence, and Analytics. I must say, I thoroughly enjoy my courses, especially the one taught by Professor Benjamin. He has a remarkable way of making the material truly fascinating.

The topics covered in our classes are diverse and stimulating. If you have a passion for working with Big Data or are interested in exploring this field, I highly encourage you to join us. Together, we can embark on an exciting journey of discovery and innovation.

Looking forward to seeing you in class!
