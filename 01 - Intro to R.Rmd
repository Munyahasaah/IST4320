# Intro to R for Data Analytics

```{r}
#please check the lecture for explanations ðŸ˜€
library(tidyverse) #this loads an R package to the current instance. 
install.packages("tidyverse") #this installs an R package. You only need to do this once (but maybe again on new server)
install.packages("readxl") #this package has a function that lets us read in excel files
library(readxl)
demo <- read_excel("C:/Users/mcasa/CSUSB/IST 2510/demo.xlsx") #this will load the FIRST sheet of data from my excel spreadsheet
#and it stores it into the object called data
names(demo) #this will show us the column names inside the data tibble
```

### Common data formats in R

Data is often worked in R in several object formats

-   Tidyverse tibbles

-   Base R vectors or dataframes

-   Data.table

```{r}
demo["age"] #this is a tibble (tidyverse, upgraded R). We'll use this a lot in class
demo[["age"]] #this is a vector from Base R (the original R), or multiple vectors can be combined in a dataframe
demo$`age` #this also gives a Base R vector

library(data.table)  #this loads the data.table object format functions
as.data.table(demo) #this is a data.table format. We may or may not use this format in class.
```
